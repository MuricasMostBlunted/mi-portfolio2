<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like videogames, hiking, and the outdoors.</p>

<p>Really, it's not just those three things but there are a great deal of things that I truly enjoy.
I'm an avid learner who seeks to learn new skillsets.
Currently, my interest is in van conversion which is really a suite of various skills such as carpentry, plumbing, hvac, use of power tools and so forth.
Then again, my interest changes at the drop of a dime.

<p>Upon builing my van, I'm hoping to travel the states. I wonder if this will be a costly hobby?
  Gas is costly, tools will be required to be purchased, and I have to purchase a van. DaaaAaaaaMmmMMMMmmN.
